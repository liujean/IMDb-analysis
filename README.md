# IMDb-analysis
IMDb (Internet Movie Database) is one of the most recognized names for its comprehensive online database collection of movies, films, TV series and so on. As of today (July 2020), youâ€™ll see through the following data pull that IMDb database has approximately 7 million titles. In this article I will use Python in Jupyter Notebook to demonstrate where to pull the data, how to quickly interpret the data and answer some interesting questions including
- What kind of data does the IMDb database cover?
- What kind of ratings do people give in general? Is it really a normal distribution? Which movies get the best ratings?
- Based on the movies that I like, which ones should I also check out?
